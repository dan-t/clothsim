Some kind of bogus cloth simulation.


Make and Install:
   cabal install cabal-dev

   git clone https://github.com/dan-t/Gamgine
   git clone https://github.com/dan-t/clothsim

   cd layers
   cabal-dev add-source ../Gamgine
   cabal-dev install

   (If the Gamgine directory isn't in the same directoy than the layers one,
    than 'Include-dirs' in 'layers.cabal' has to be modified)
